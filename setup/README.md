Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Clone [this](https://github.com/SEI-Remote/css-card-deck) repository, and enter the new directory: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SEI-Remote/css-card-deck
cd css-card-deck
```

Delete the `.git` info from the cloned template: 

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

> Make sure you delete the .git info when you clone a template like this.  It’s starter code being provided by GA and you don’t need our commits on it!
