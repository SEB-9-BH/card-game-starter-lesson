# ![CSS Card Deck - Setup](./assets/hero.png)

Open your Terminal application and navigate to your `~/code/ga/lectures` directory:

```bash
cd ~/code/ga/lectures
```

Clone [this](git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/css-card-deck-starter) repository, and enter the new directory: 

```bash
git clone git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/css-card-deck-starter
cd css-card-deck-starter
```

Delete the `.git` info from the cloned template: 

```bash
rm -rf .git
```

> Make sure you delete the .git info when you clone a template like this.  It’s starter code being provided by GA and you don’t need our commits on it!

With the repository cloned, open the contents of the directory in VS Code:

```bash
code .
```
